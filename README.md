## Description

Using a public API from nobelprize.readme.io, we are calling back all US Born Nobel Prize winners and giving details about them in the webpage using Axios API.
  
## Live App: https://emeritus101.github.io/ReactFetchAndRender/
  
  
## Roadmap
* Include filters on page to send parameters to the API such as first name, last name, year born, city of birth, so on.
* Get results in a tabular format
* Include second level API node elements (category, prize, year)
